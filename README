To run the server, get into the directory of the mvnw in a console and write:
./mvnw spring-boot:run

To make a request to the server go to the directory of the request.xml file (currently in the same directory as mvnw) and write in a console:
curl --header "content-type: text/xml" -d @request.xml http://localhost:8080/ws

There are different examples in request.xml file.
